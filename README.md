### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

For potential employers: If you are curious about what I am working on or have been recently, you will not be able to see that here, unfortunately, as the work with my current employer is not public. For an idea of how often I am writing code and contributing to projects, see the graph for my work account (https://github.com/jvalentine-cni).

For previous projects that I'm proud of, take a look at the projects pinned below.
